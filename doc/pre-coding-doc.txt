# Plans for garbage raycasting
incompetence meets programming

## General idea

Main function won't do much besides some basic setup
It'll kick off the main loop with a function call

Game class which will contain the main loop
Which handles events, call window clears/presents and renders
: Needs constructor which needs a pointer to the window and player
: The header file for this class will need includes to nearly all headers as it is responsible for making sure different classes can work together
: Class should hold pointer arrays to rects and lines
: Loop will call a function which will go through these arrays to draw everything

There should be a class for the window,
: Constructor to create window + renderer
: Relevant getters/setters
: Render function to draw something to the renderer. Needs a parameter to determine what's being rendered, e.g. rect, line, point etc

Raycasting class
: Makes a map
: Creates the pointer arrays that the game class needs 

Player class
: Values like position and direction
: Getters and setters for those values
: Possibly also methods of calculating certain things, e.g. how much to rotate when the turn key is pressed

Header file for all math related functions
: Ya like trigonometry?
